  <p>
    The dreamkit entry allows you to programmatically define routes in a single
    file.
  </p>

  <p>
    It can be used as an optional alternative to the file routing system and
    both can work together at the same time. In addition, it has an advanced
    tree shaking system that separates each route with its dependencies and is
    compatible with HMR.
  </p>

  <p>
    All examples shown in the documentation make use of this mechanic to more
    easily illustrate the code.

  <Example
    {...normalizeExample({ default: homeRouteExample })}
    fileName="/src/dreamkit.tsx"
    id="example"
    title="Example"
  />

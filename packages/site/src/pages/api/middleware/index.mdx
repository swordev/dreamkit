Middleware class builder.

Middlewares are classes that can be exported in the DreamKit input and allow
you to intervene in requests.

The middleware constructor allows you to inject dependencies registered by
services or use some of those available in the request context: Request,
RequestUrl, Headers, IocContext.

It is recommended that the middleware consumes lighter dependencies to avoid
loading it with complexity, for example, if you need to access the headers,
use Headers and avoid consuming Request.

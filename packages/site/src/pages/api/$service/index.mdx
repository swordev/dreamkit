Services are classes that can be exported in the <a href="/entry">entry</a> and allow you to initialize configurations that remain alive throughout the
application's lifecycle.

If you edit a service in development mode, that service will be safely restarted.

It is common to use services to initialize databases and register them in the IoC context so that other objects can consume them (<a href="/api/$middleware">middleware</a>, <a href="/api/$api">api</a>).

<div slot="post-definition">

<H3>self</H3>

Consumes dependencies registered in the IoC context so that they can be used internally by the function.

By default there are a number of registered objects available:

- <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request">Request</a>
- <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers">Headers</a>
- AppContext

<H3>create</H3>

Create an abstract service class with the configured <a href="#self">instance</a>. You must override the method `onStart` to implement the service logic.

If a function is returned in the `onStart` method, it will be called when the service stops.

```ts
export class MyService extends $service.create() {
  override onStart() {
    console.log("Starting");
    return () => console.log("Stopping");
  }
}
```

</div>

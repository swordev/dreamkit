  <p>
    Controlled components are well known in the React community but are not
    available in Solid.js as it does not work with a virtual DOM.
  </p>
  <p>
    While it is possible to emulate the behaviour of a controlled component with
    the 'onInput' listener, it is not really possible and there are many cases
    where the component is no longer controlled.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the Input component it is possible to control its value and also ensure
    TypeScript typing based on the field type.

Type-safe and/or controlled input component.

Controlled components are well known in the React community but are not
available in Solid.js as it does not work with a virtual DOM.

While it is possible to emulate the behaviour of a controlled component with
the 'onInput' listener, it is not really possible and there are many cases
where the component is no longer controlled.

With the Input component it is possible to control its value and also ensure
TypeScript typing based on the field type.

Service class builder.

Services are classes that can be exported in the DreamKit entry and allow
you to initialize configurations that remain alive throughout the
application's lifecycle.

If you edit a service in development mode, that service will be safely
restarted.

The service constructor allows you to inject dependencies that will be
resolved when the service is started.

It is common to use services to initialize databases and register them in
the IoC context so that other objects can consume them (ex: middleware,
api).

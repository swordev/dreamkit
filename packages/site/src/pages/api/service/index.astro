  <p>
    Services are classes that can be exported in the DreamKit entry and allow
    you to initialize configurations that remain alive throughout the
    application's lifecycle.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you edit a service in development mode, that service will be safely
    restarted.
  </p>

  <p>
    The service constructor allows you to inject dependencies that will be
    resolved when the service is started.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is common to use services to initialize databases and register them in
    the IoC context so that other objects can consume them (ex: middleware,
    api).

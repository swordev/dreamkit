  <p>
    Inversion of control is a very versatile tool that helps you manage
    dependency injection.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the great advantages of @dreamkit/ioc is that it does not use
    decorators, is fully typed, and allows you to manually inject dependencies
    for testing purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    DreamKit uses it extensively and hands over part of its management to the
    user, allowing the user to consume only the dependencies they need and/or
    create their own dependencies.

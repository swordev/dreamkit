With the API builder you can create functions that can be used by routes.

You can also consume objects registered by services and middlewares and you
will have automatic validation of input parameters on the client (before the
request is created) and server.

If you define a parameter schema in the API you can reference this schema on
the client for various purposes such as auto-generating the UI or reusing
other schema data such as titles.

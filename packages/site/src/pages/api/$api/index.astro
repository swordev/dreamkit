  <p>
    With the API builder you can create functions that can be used by routes.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also consume objects registered by services and middlewares and you
    will have automatic validation of input parameters on the client (before the
    request is created) and server.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you define a parameter schema in the API you can reference this schema on
    the client for various purposes such as auto-generating the UI or reusing
    other schema data such as titles.
